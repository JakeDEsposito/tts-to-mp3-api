### TTS To MP3 API

A simple way to get an mp3 file or audio buffer data as an api call

## How it works

Run

```
npm start
```

or build and run the project as a docker file to start it up.

Then navigate to http://"URL":"PORT"/?type=tts&language=en&text="TEXT" or [localhost](http://localhost:80/?type=tts&language=en&text=Thanks%20for%20checking%20out%20this%20project.)
